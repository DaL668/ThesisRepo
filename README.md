The thesis performs classification tasks on anonymous (Tor) traffic by adapting a RL paradigm. <br />
The environment is a network environment where anonymous and non-anonymous traffic presents across time.
The goal is to reduce the reliance on labels and subsititue labels with pre-defined thresholds. One focus of the thesis is to design and determine the thresholds.<br />
PyTorch is applied to build and train neural networks. Scikit Learn is utilized to perfrom feature engineering.  
Accuracy is the evaluating metric.
